Fast Python learner ‚Äì naive method: Make useful utility application in Python from scratch 

How to approach learning?

That is very often dilemma for the educators in any field of human knowledge. Experts who are well educated and skilled in some topic are not always great motivators for the beginners who are just making their first bite in the new knowledge fruit.
Same thing goes with learning new language. You can start with grammar and slowly build words repository, or you can go with ‚Äúnaive‚Äù approach and just start speaking. Native speaking girlfriend or boyfriend can accelerate learning of new language faster than any teacher üòä. The key concept is to learn most common phrases and complete sentences, and with time master the whole language. It is in nutshell a same learning experience and method that we all had when we learn to speak when we were in first years of our life. Rules for spelling and grammar will follow in the future one day.
So, we want to learn new programing language and you want to see some tangible results for your effort. A new application made by you will be a great motivator for further learning.
Problem with traditional approach, and something what educators often fail to understand, is that motivation level will drop down with time invested. Starting with language syntax and core concepts of programing language will prolong time to build something useful. ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù kind of app will just not be good enough to boost motivation for beginner in any programming language.
Anyhow all above mentioned is my personal experience and now I will not elaborate it anymore. It is much better to start coding something useful in the ‚Äúna√Øve‚Äù way.

Let‚Äôs start!
My assumption is that you are total beginner in Python and that you are using Microsoft Windows environment. Just to mention that switch to Linux is very easy since Python is almost fully multiplatform language.
Step 1: Set your Python development environment
